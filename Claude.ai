# Delta Neutral Strategy Using ynETHx, ynUSDx, and ynBTCx

## Objective
This strategy aims to:
1. Earn **yield from yield-bearing assets** (ynETHx, ynBTCx, and ynUSDx).
2. Maintain **delta neutrality** by offsetting crypto exposure with hedging.
3. Automate **rebalancing** to maintain neutral exposure and optimize returns.

## Step-by-Step Strategy Implementation

### 1. Construct the Portfolio with Yield-Bearing Assets
- **Deposit ETH → Get ynETHx** (staked ETH with yield).
- **Deposit BTC → Get ynBTCx** (staked BTC with yield).
- **Deposit USDC or DAI → Get ynUSDx** (yield-bearing stablecoin).

### 2. Hedge the Portfolio to Maintain Delta Neutrality
Since **ynETHx and ynBTCx are exposed to price fluctuations**, hedge by:
- **Shorting ETH to offset ynETHx exposure**.
- **Shorting BTC to offset ynBTCx exposure**.

This ensures that even if ETH or BTC price moves, the portfolio remains **delta-neutral**.

### 3. Deploy ynUSDx in Yield-Bearing Pools
- Provide liquidity in **Curve, Aave, Morpho, or similar DeFi protocols**.
- Consider farming opportunities with **auto-compounding rewards**.

### 4. Automate Rebalancing Based on Market Movements
Use a **volatility-based rebalancing mechanism**:
- **Monitor ETH and BTC price movements using standard deviation thresholds (e.g., ±2σ moves)**.
- **If ETH/BTC price rises too fast** → Reduce short positions.
- **If ETH/BTC price drops significantly** → Increase short positions.

This ensures that the portfolio stays **delta-neutral** while **maximizing yield**.

## Expected Returns
| **Component**        | **Estimated APR** |
|----------------------|------------------|
| **ynETHx Staking Yield** | **3-6%** |
| **ynBTCx Yield** | **2-5%** |
| **ynUSDx Yield** | **4-8%** |
| **Hedging Costs (Shorts)** | **(-1 to -3%)** |
| **Net Estimated APR** | **7-16%** |

## Risk Considerations
- **Liquidation Risk**: Overleveraging short hedges can cause forced liquidations.
- **Funding Rate Sensitivity**: Shorting ETH/BTC in perpetual markets incurs variable funding costs.
- **Depegging Risk**: ynUSDx should maintain a strong peg to minimize deviations.
